# Teaching

Those are courses I have written in colaborations with other people (cited of course), for either the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatic (SIB) or the university of Basel where I work for sciCORE and CeDA. They should not be considered as final product as they are constantly evolving : they will not be updated here.

Sometimes the datasets for the exercises or exemples will not be available as they are related to publications that are not free to view. But the sources of those datasets will be given so if you have access to those publications you will be able to run the nootebooks completly.

- **Intro_deep_learning** : workshop style course developed by the CeDA (Rodrigo Cerqueira Gonzalez Pena and me). The focus was a basic introduction to bits and pieces of Deep learning as well as most basic architectures, with example based on biological sequences. 
- **Intro_to_stats_in_life_sciences** : SIB course written with Wandrille Duchemin. Basic intro to statistics, statistical concept, linear modeling and statistical tests common in biology.
- **My_jit** : a little notebook showcasing how easy and great it is to use numba (CPU parallelisation, not much of GPU here).
- **scikit_learn_ML** : SIB course with Wandrille Duchemin and Markus Mueller involved. Introduction to classical machine learning algorithm and methodology using scikit learn. Opening to deep learning with Pytorch.
- **statistic_and_machine_learning_for_life_sciences** : SIB course with Wandrille Duchemin. From Linear model to Generalized linear model to classical machine learning.
